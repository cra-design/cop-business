  <!--<h2 id="h-3">When you need a CRA program account</h2>
  <p>Depending on your business  activities, you may need to register for certain program accounts to interact  with the CRA. Each CRA program account has its own rules and registration  requirements. You must review these to determine what you need for your business  and your obligations once you've registered.</p>
  <p>Your business number is the  unique standard identifier for your business and makes up a part of your CRA  program account number. You can only have one BN for your business or legal  entity.</p>
  <p>If you already have a business  number (BN), you will be asked for your BN when you register for a CRA program  account. Once you've registered for the program account, it will be added to  your existing BN. </p>-->

	 
  <h2 id="h-1">Understand CRA program account numbers </h2>
	<p>When you register for program accounts such as GST/HST or payroll, you will be given a CRA program account number. Each program account has a 2-letter program identifier and a reference number which is added to your business number (BN) if you already have one. You must use your CRA program account number to report your business activities to the CRA.<p>

  <p>If you do not have a  BN, you will automatically get a one when you register for a CRA program  account.</p>
	<p>A CRA program account number consists of: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your unique 9-digit business number (BN)</li>
    <li>A 2-letter program identifier to indicate the program account type</li>
    <li>A 4-digit reference number to identify specfic program accounts if you have more than one of the same type</li>
  </ul>

  <!--p>Each CRA program account has its own rules and requirements about when you need to register.</p>

    <summary>Example - Program account numbers for GST/HST and payroll</summary>
    <p>Kai started a business this year selling jewellery they've designed. Since sales will over $30,000 this year, they will have to start charging GST/HST. This means they will need to register for a GST/HST account. </p>
	  <p>Since Kai does not have a business number, they will automatically get a business number when they register for a GST/HST account: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>123456789</strong> - Business number (BN) </li>
      <li><strong>123456789 RT 0001</strong> - GST/HST program account number</li>
      
    </ul>
	  <p>A few months later, Kai wants to hire someone to help out at the store. Since Kai already received a BN when he registered for a GST/HST account, the same BN can be used to register for a payroll deductions account:</p>
	     <ul>
           <li><strong>123456789 RP 0001</strong> - Payroll program account number</li>
    </ul>
  </details>
  <h2 id="h-2">Program account types</h2>
	<p>Your business must register for CRA program accounts if you conduct certain business activities that need to be reported to the CRA. These activities may include if you collect GST/HST, hire employees, or incorporate your business.</p>
	<p>Each CRA program account has its own registration and reporting requirements. You must review these to determine what you need for your business and your obligations once you've registered.</p>
