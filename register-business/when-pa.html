    <summary>Example - Program account numbers for GST/HST and payroll</summary>
    <p>Kai started a business this year selling jewellery they've designed. Since sales will be close to $30,000 this year, they will have to start charging GST/HST. This means they will need to get a GST/HST account. </p>
	  <p>Since Kai does not have a business number, they will automatically get a business number when they register for a GST/HST account: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>123456789</strong> - Business number (BN) </li>
      <li><strong>123456789 RT 0001</strong> - GST/HST program account number</li>
      
    </ul>
	  <p>A few months later, Kai wants to hire someone to help out at the store. Since Kai already received a BN when he registered for a GST/HST account, the same BN can be used to register for a payroll deductions account:</p>
	     <ul>
           <li><strong>123456789 RP 0001</strong> - Payroll program account number</li>
    </ul>
  </details>
  <h2 id="h-2">When you need a CRA program account</h2>
	<p>Your business must register for CRA program accounts if you conduct certain business activities that need to be reported to the CRA. These activities may include if you collect GST/HST, hire employees, or incorporate your business.</p>
	<p>Each CRA program account has its own registration and reporting requirements. You must review these to determine what you need for your business and your obligations once you've registered.</p>
